# Questionnaires
Here, I will upload psychometric questionnaires formatted into Python using the PsychoPy library. 
The motivation behind this is to 1) avoid paper and pen testing; 2) limiting the need for proprietary software.
The latter in particular cannot guarantee our participants' and patients' confidentiality, depending on 
where their data is stored. 
With these scripts, you can collect psychometric questionnaire data to save locally. 
Resultant files (.csv) are small, so storage should not be an issue. 

To date, the following questionnaires are listed (in FRENCH):

1. Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan, 1995)
2. Situational Pain Questionnaire (Clark & Yang, 1983) 
3. Relationship Assessment Scale (Hendricks et al., 1988)
4. Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983; Gilet et al., 2012)
